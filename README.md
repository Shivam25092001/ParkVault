-  Park Vault is a solution for cities with the power of software and ML technologies to bring large benefits to its citizens with almost zero added infrastructure cost.

- It is an intelligent & automated parking system that assists drivers in finding a parking space through a web-app-based system compatible with any device. Available spaces are usually indicated on the mobile application, to navigate drivers to a vacant spot. The system includes the use of low maintenance battery powered Automatic number plate recognition and QR code scanner to collect real-time data. The web-app helps drivers find available parking spaces and also choose parking slots within those spaces without much hassle.
